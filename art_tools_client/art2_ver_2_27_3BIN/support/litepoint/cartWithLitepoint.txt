Installation and setup for running litepoint with cart/nart:
1) Install dotnetframework support\dotnetfx.exe
2) Install cart/nart (copy folder bin, command, support folder to your PC)
3) Install matlab runtime v79 to make sure Litepoint dlls runs on your PC, ask Litepoint for this.
   For IQ2010, install IQ201x GUI come from Litepoint, which will install 
	Matlab runtime v79
	IQ2010 device driver (check from device manager to make sure IQ2010 driver is installed ok)
4) Run microsoft redistribution exe support\vcredist_x86.exe
   For art2_v2_21 up, Also need to run microsoft 2008 redistribution exe support\litepoint\vcredist_x86-VC2008.exe
5) For art2_v2_21 up, Run support\Litepoint\Litepoint_install.bat to install Litepoint related files.
6) In bin\start.art, 
   (a) Set up path loss:
       For art2_v4_x and up:
	   You need to set path loss for device=VSA, device=VSG, and device=SA 
	   The path loss values are same for all type. (From Litepoint RF port to DUT RF connectors.)
       For art2_v2_x and art2_v3_x:
	   You need to set path loss for device=PM, and device=SA (VSA, VSG will are use PM path loss)
	   The path loss values are same for both type. (From Litepoint RF port to DUT RF connectors.)
   (b) Set up equipment:
	For IQView, IQFlex:
       		equipment model=litepoint; arg=192.168.100.254
	For IQnxn  (only work with art2_4_x up)
	        equipment model=litepoint; arg=192.168.100.254,192.168.100.253,192.168.100.252;
	For IQ2010 
	        equipment model=litepoint; arg=127.0.0.1
   (c) Comment out all the other equipements setting in start.art (including variable attenuators)
7) start nart in one console window
8) start cart -local localhost in another console window
9) type test_flow in cart console window to start the manufacture flow test.
10) This release doesn't tested Litepoint box together with Golden unit and external Attenuators for throughput test.


Setting parameters for Litepoint test in bin\Litepoint_setup.txt
If user doesn't have this file in bin folder or never change any setting since the Atheros release,
all the Litepoint related settings are as default (described in the Litepoint_setup.txt)
1) If customer wants to use dual head two litepoint testers during manufacture test set up, 
   please change the Litepoint_setup.txt as:
	(a) For the cart to run Litepoint connect to left RF port, RFPORT=0; DUALHEAD_ENABLE=1;
	    User should start the test_flow of this tester first.
	(b) For the cart to run Litepoint connect to right RF port, RFPORT=1; DUALHEAD_ENABLE=1;
	    User should start the test_flow of this tester after (a) start the flow test.
2) User can change the EVM analysis parameters in Litepoint_setup.txt to evaluate EVM in different way.
   This applies for both mimo and legacy OFDM EVM evaluation analysis parameters seperately.



Test flags in test script command line setting:
1) For single box, composite EVM measurement in Tx command line, always setting evm=1; The report power is stream power.
   For IQnxn DVT EVM measurement 
	EVM: 1 (report stream power and stream EVM value)
	     2 (report chain power and chain EVM value)
	Note: for single stream data rate you have to use txchain=7; evm=2; to get each chain's power and evm.
	      for single stream data rate, evm=1, no matter what you set for txchain, it only gives you first stream(=chain)'s power and evm.
